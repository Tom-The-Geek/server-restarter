# server-restarter

How to use:
1. Download mod.
2. Place in mods folder.
3. Create a file called `config/server_restarter.json` and fill out this template: (temporary solution until I implement [#1](https://github.com/Geek202/server-restarter/issues/1))
```json
{
  "webhook_url": "",
  "scheduled_actions": []
}
```
5. Profit

NOTE: The server launch also needs to be wrapped with [server-launcher](https://github.com/Geek202/server-launcher)
